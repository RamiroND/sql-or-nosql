# SQL or NoSQL?  Why not use both (with PostgreSQL)?

It's a tough decision for any developer starting a new project.  Should you store your data in a standard, time-tested SQL database, or go with one of the newer NoSQL document-based databases?  This seemingly simple decision can literally make or break your project down the line.  Choose correctly and structure your data well, and you may sail smoothly into production and watch your app take off.  Make the wrong choice, and you could be headed for nightmares (and maybe even some major re-writes) before your app ever makes it out the door.
